The Editorial Board is pleased to introduce the new Chiang Mai Journal of Science in succession to the former Journal of the Science Faculty of Chiang Mai University. The new title is a snappier one which we hope will soon become well known amongst the scientific communities both at home and abroad. With its re-designed cover, we would like to think that, in time, Chiang Mai J. Sci. will become instantly recognisable with an attractive content to match its new appearance.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the name change, the Journal’s affiliation to the Faculty of Science remains as clear as ever. The Faculty’s crest is retained on the front cover as is the former title. Indeed, it is the Editorial Board’s intention to help promote the Faculty of Science through the Journal’s new image and the upgrading of its refereeing procedures. With more emphasis and importance being attached to research, it is essential that the Faculty has a peer-reviewed Journal which is commensurate in quality with its growing reputation as a research centre of both national and international repute.<br/>
<br/>
The Editorial Board sincerely hopes that the readership likes these new changes. While editorial policy remains the same, we will be hoping to attract more papers from outside Thailand now that the Journal title has a wider appeal. After many years under the previous title, and coinciding with the start of a new millenium, the time seems ripe for a change.<br/>
<br/>
And so to all our readers and potential contributors, a warm welcome to the Chiang Mai Journal of Science, the new Journal of the Science Faculty of Chiang Mai University. We look forward to receiving your continuing support.<br/>
