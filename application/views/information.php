INFORMATION  FOR  CONTRIBUTORS<br/>
<br/>
EDITORIAL POLICY<br/>
The Chiang Mai Journal of Scienceis an international English language peer-reviewed journal which is published 4 times a year in January, April, July and October by the Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University.  Manuscripts in most areas of science are welcomed for publication free of charge except in areas such as agricultural, engineering and medical science which are outside the scope of the Journal.  Papers in the mathematical sciences (mathematics, statistics and computer science) are included but should be of an applied nature rather than simply pure mathematics.        Manuscripts describing experiments on humans or animals are required to provide proof that all experiments have been carried out according to the ethical regulations of the respective institutional and/or governmental authorities and this should be clearly stated in the manuscript itself.  The Editor reserves the right to reject manuscripts that fail to do so.
Papers which have already been published in other journals or which are under consideration by other journals should not be submitted.  Similarly, papers published here should not be submitted to other journals.  Special issues can also be published by prior arrangement.  Manuscripts that are suspected to involve plagiarism or other types of ethical misconduct, including but not limited to duplicate publication, multiple submission or salami slicing, will also be rejected.<br/>
<br/>
TYPES OF MANUSCRIPT<br/>
Manuscripts may be submitted in the form of Review Articles, Research Papers or Short Communications where, as an approximate guide to length:<br/>
<br/>
Review Articles would not normally exceed 30 pages of double-spaced A4 text, inclusive of tables, figures and references.  Maximum 50 references.  Reviews are normally by invitation only but prospective authors are welcome to contact the Editor or appropriate Associate Editor to discuss possible contributions.<br/>
Research Papers would not normally exceed 20 pages of double-spaced A4 text, similarly all-inclusive. The number of references should not exceed 30.<br/>
Short Communications would not normally exceed 8 pages of double-spaced A4 text, including not more than 2 tables and 2 figures and a maximum of 10 references.<br/>
Manuscripts that exceed the stated length limit will be subject to a 50 US$ or 1,500 Baht surcharge for each additional page.
<br/>
PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS<br/>
Manuscripts submitted for publication will normally consist of the following sections: Title, Authors Names and Addresses, Abstract (including Keywords), Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results and Discussion, Conclusions, Acknowledgements (if any), and References.  For format and general style, authors should refer to current issues (see also the Journal website) as a guide.  Manuscripts that do not conform to these guidelines will be rejected at the submission stage.Photographs, figures and line drawings should be of optimum quality.  Colour photographs are acceptable where necessary but the extra costs involved in their reproduction must be borne by the author(s).<br/>
Only references actually cited in the main text should be included in the References section and should be cited in numerical order.  Manuscripts should be typed as MSWord documents using double-spacing on A4-sized pages with justified text.  Any tables and figures should follow at the end of the main text and be saved in the same document file.  SI units of measurement should be used throughout.<br/>
<br/>
It is strongly recommended that, where appropriate, the paper should be proof-read by a native English speaker, or at least someone proficient in the English language, before being submitted so as to avoid the possibility of rejection on language rather than scientific grounds.<br/>

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE<br/>
Manuscripts should be submitted online as a single MSWord document file via the Journal website at:
http://epg.science.cmu.ac.th/ejournal/<br/>
Following submission, receipt of the manuscript will be acknowledged by a return e-mail containing a Manuscript Number which should be quoted in all subsequent correspondence.<br/>
When submitting a paper, authors are also required to provide the names and affiliations (including e-mail addresses) of at least 5 possible reviewers whom the authors consider to be well qualified to review the paper.  However, this is not meant to imply that the paper will be sent to these reviewers.  This is simply a measure designed to avoid long delays in the event that reviewers are difficult to find.  Normally, the paper will be refereed by 2-3 reviewers.<br/>
<br/>
REVIEW PROCEDURE<br/>
Following receipt of the manuscript, it will be first screened for its suitability for the Journal by the assigned Associate Editor.  This initial screening also includes the use of ‘Turnitin’ software for plagiarism detection.  Having passed through this initial screening process, it will then be sent to a minimum of two external reviewers (double-blind system).  In the event of differences of opinion amongst the reviewers regarding the merits of the manuscript, the final decision will rest with the Editor.  The Journal will make every effort to inform the authors of its decision within 3 months after submission and, if accepted, to publish the manuscript within a further 6 months (including the time taken to make any revisions).
Manuscripts accepted but requiring revisions must be returned to the Journal within the timeframe specified by the handling Associate Editor highlighting the changes that have been made.  Detailed responses to the reviewers’ comments should also be given in a covering letter.  A revised manuscript returned after the deadline has expired without giving prior notice to the handling Associate Editor will be treated as a new submission.<br/>
In the case of manuscripts considered to be unsuitable for publication, the reasons for rejection will be clearly explained.  In some cases, an article submitted as a Research Paper may be recommended for acceptance as a Short Communication instead, especially where the work is of topical interest but is of limited scope and length.<br/>
Following acceptance, an electronic copy of the paper typeset as it will appear in the Journal (for final proof-reading) and a Copyright Transfer Agreement will be e-mailed to the corresponding author.  The paper (indicating any final corrections) and the signed Copyright Transfer Agreement must be returned as soon as possible.  Manuscripts will be published only after receiving the signed Copyright Transfer Agreement.  Finally, following publication, an electronic copy (PDF file) of the paper can be downloaded from the Journal website and one hardcopy of the Journal issue in which it appears will be sent by air mail to the corresponding author free of charge.<br/>
